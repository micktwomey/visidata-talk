# Who am I?

# Michael Twomey

	Senior Cloud Architect at fourTheorem
	I help clients with AWS and Python development

Yes I don't know what a senior cloud architect is either

	I've been working with messy data for 20+ years
	Messy data isn't just for Data Scientists üòÜ

	I'm an unashamed UNIX user
	I live in the terminal (most of the time)

---

	I like Terminal based applications

	I frequently have to deal with random data

---

# What is VisiData?

Think Excel for your command line with python scripting

Or think what would happen if Excel had vim or emacs style key bindings?

---

# Is VisiData for You?

```sh
pip install visidata
vd myfile.csv  
```

```
pipx run visidata myfile.csv
```

	If you love Excel and are proficient in it, probably not

	If you hate the terminal definitely not!

	If you hate learning keybindings this isn't for you!

If you frequently finding yourself wanting to quickly look at some data it might be

If you like using the terminal probably!
